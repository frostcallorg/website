		<h1><b>About Frost Call</b></h1>
		<h3><u>Vision Statement</u></h3><br>
			<i>“Continued camaraderie for veterans through gaming”</i><br><br>
			Our vision is twofold:<br>
			1) For those who have left the service, and seek the camaraderie found within the military, we hope to foster those connections within the gaming community.<br>
			2) Adjustment to civilian life can be challenging, and we aim to reduce stigma and encourage support-seeking with peers and professionals to improve mental health and wellbeing within the veteran community.<br>
		<br>

		<h3><u>Core Values</u></h3><br>
		1. <b>Proximity</b>: Connecting veterans through local events and within an online community. <br>
		2. <b>Wellbeing</b>: Fostering mental health by filling the gap left after military service, and advocating for mental health and supportive services. <br>
		3. <b>Inclusivity</b>: We serve all who serve, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, and era of service.<br>
		<br>

		<h3><u>Objectives</u></h3><br>
		Increase connections between veterans in the community through local events and an online hub<br>
		Provide welcoming spaces for veterans in the community to connect with one another while enjoying free video and tabletop games <br>
		Connect with local veteran organizations to provide free gaming services at locations where veterans already connect with one another <br>
		Increase health and wellbeing through vet-to-vet support and provision of resources at Frost Call events<br>
